{Opening paragraph acknowledging their specific issue}

**What we found**

{Explanation of findings in customer-friendly language. Use bullets if listing multiple items, otherwise conversational paragraphs.}

**Next steps**

{Clear explanation of what happens next — whether it's a bug we're creating an issue for, a workaround they can use, additional information we need, or confirmation that the behavior is expected.}

{Closing with offer for follow-up if needed}

**Style Guidelines:**
- Friendly-professional tone — approachable but competent
- Light formatting only (subheadings, bullets where helpful)
- No heavy Markdown headers (##, ###)
- Conversational flow as primary structure
- Acknowledge the specific issue they reported
- Be direct about findings (bug, expected behavior, need more info)
- Customer-friendly language (avoid engineering jargon)
- Clear next steps
- No over-apologizing or excessive formality
- No promises about fix timelines (engineering owns that)
