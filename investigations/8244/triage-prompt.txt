# Support Ticket Triage — Investigation #8244

## Mode
- Agent Mode: team
- Execution Mode: new

## Instructions
You are conducting a support ticket investigation using the Support Ticket Triage System.

Read the following files for complete context:
1. /Users/jacobaguon/support-triage/CLAUDE.md — Full agent instructions and protocols
2. /Users/jacobaguon/support-triage/settings.json — System configuration

## Your Task

**START NEW INVESTIGATION**

1. Fetch Pylon ticket #8244 using Pylon MCP
2. Read the request_type and product_area fields
3. Apply the classification routing table from CLAUDE.md
4. Present classification at Checkpoint 1 and wait for human approval
5. Spawn the appropriate agent team (or run single-agent mode if --single)
6. Execute Phase 1: Parallel context gathering
   - connector-code-specialist OR product-code-reviewer (based on classification)
   - issue-historian
   - slack-context-researcher
7. Present findings at Checkpoint 2 and wait for human approval
8. Execute Phase 2: Synthesis
   - Generate summary.md
   - Generate linear-draft.md (for bugs)
   - Generate customer-response.md
9. Present complete investigation at Checkpoint 3 and wait for validation
10. Apply any revisions requested by human
11. Present final outputs at Checkpoint 4 for solution check

## Output Location
All files should be written to: /Users/jacobaguon/support-triage/investigations/8244/

Required outputs:
- summary.md
- customer-response.md
- linear-draft.md (for bugs only)
- agent-transcript.txt
- metrics.json

## Remember
- Read CLAUDE.md for full protocols and safety guardrails
- All checkpoints are mandatory unless auto-proceed is enabled
- Always cite sources (Linear #, Slack links, file:line)
- ~/C1/ is READ-ONLY
- Never create Linear issues or send Pylon messages
- Default to Level 2 code analysis, prompt for Level 3

## Database Update
After completing each checkpoint, update the database:
```bash
sqlite3 /Users/jacobaguon/support-triage/triage.db "UPDATE investigations SET current_checkpoint='checkpoint_name', updated_at='timestamp' WHERE id=8244;"
```

When investigation is complete:
```bash
sqlite3 /Users/jacobaguon/support-triage/triage.db "UPDATE investigations SET status='complete', resolved_at='timestamp' WHERE id=8244;"
```

Begin investigation now.
