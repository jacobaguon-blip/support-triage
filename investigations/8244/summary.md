# Investigation: #8244 — Lookout

## Ticket Summary
Lookout is requesting a workflow for production VPN access using ConductorOne. They want a custom app that grants time-limited (12-hour) Okta group membership for VPN access, similar to their existing EPA access setup, without showing the Okta app in the user's request screen.

## Recommended Actions
1. Search Linear for existing time-limited access / temporary group membership features
2. Check if current Okta connector supports time-based group add/remove
3. Review similar EPA access setup for this customer as reference architecture
4. Determine if this requires new feature work or can be accomplished with existing capabilities

## Open Questions / Escalation Needs
- Does the Okta connector currently support time-limited group membership?
- Is there a "hidden app" capability in the request catalog?
- How was their EPA access configured — can we replicate the pattern?
