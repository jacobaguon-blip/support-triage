Hi there! Thanks for reaching out about the VPN access request flow — sounds like a great use case.

We've started looking into this to see the best way to set it up. From what you've described, you're looking for:

- A custom app that grants the ability to request prod VPN access on-demand
- Time-limited Okta group membership (12 hours) when access is requested
- The Okta app itself not visible in the user's request screen

Since you mentioned it's similar to your existing EPA access setup, we'd love to reference that configuration as a starting point.

We'd be happy to hop on a call to walk through the options together. Could you share a few times that work for your team this week? In the meantime, we'll look into the current capabilities around time-limited group actions with Okta.

Looking forward to getting this set up for you!
